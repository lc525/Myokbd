# Myokbd

A simple neural interface demo.

The code implements functionality for turning an mbed OS - capable device into a
bluetooth presenter (sending commands like "next slide", "previous slide",
"blank screen" etc).

In the implementation, those commands are triggered based on filtered analog
input from a sensor measuring muscular contractions (MyoWare). A short
contraction triggers "previous slide" while a longer one (550 ms) triggers
"next slide".

The code can also be used as a general example for implementing a bluetooth
keyboard using embedded devices such as the Arduino Nano 33 BLE.
